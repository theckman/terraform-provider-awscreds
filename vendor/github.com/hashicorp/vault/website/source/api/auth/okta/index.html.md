# Okta Auth Backend HTTP API

This is the API documentation for the Vault Okta authentication backend. For
general information about the usage and operation of the Okta backend, please
see the [Vault Okta backend documentation](/docs/auth/okta.html).

This documentation assumes the Okta backend is mounted at the `/auth/okta`
path in Vault. Since it is possible to mount auth backends at any location,
please update your API calls accordingly.
