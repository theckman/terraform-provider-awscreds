# Github Auth Backend HTTP API

This is the API documentation for the Vault Github authentication backend. For
general information about the usage and operation of the Github backend, please
see the [Vault Github backend documentation](/docs/auth/github.html).

This documentation assumes the Github backend is mounted at the `/auth/github`
path in Vault. Since it is possible to mount auth backends at any location,
please update your API calls accordingly.
